 <h2>🌐 About FunWeb</h2>
<i>“Building connections, not just memorization.”</i>

<p>FunWeb, short for Fundamentals of Physics Web, is an innovative learning and remedial platform designed to help Grade 9 students strengthen their understanding of Physics concepts through interactive visualization, guided exploration, and concept mapping.</p>

<p>Developed as part of an action research project by Bachelor of Secondary Education (Science major) students of Carlos Hilado Memorial State University, FunWeb transforms abstract Physics lessons into dynamic, connected, and meaningful learning experiences.</p>

<h2>🎯 Our Purpose</h2>

<p>FunWeb was created to address one of the most common challenges among science students  academic backlogs and difficulty understanding Physics fundamentals. 
Instead of relying on repetitive drills or memorization, FunWeb provides a visual and interactive approach that helps learners see how concepts interconnect, just like a web. 

Through the FunWeb platform, students can explore essential topics such as Force, Motion, Mass, Acceleration, Energy, and Newton’s Laws, all connected in a web-like interface that shows how one concept influences the others.

“If one strand of the web is missing, the whole structure weakens, just like how missing one concept in Physics makes understanding the rest more difficult.” </p>

<h2>🧠 Our Learning Philosophy </h2>

<p>FunWeb is grounded in the Constructivist Learning Theory, which believes that students build their own understanding by connecting new knowledge to prior experiences.
Here, learning happens through:

Exploration: Students discover Physics principles through interactive activities and simulations.

Visualization: Web diagrams and concept maps show real-time relationships between ideas.

Reflection: Learners analyze and connect their experiences with scientific concepts.

This makes FunWeb not just a study tool, but a thinking tool that helps learners reconstruct understanding through curiosity and inquiry.
</p>
<h2>🔬 Our Features</h2>

<p> Interactive Concept Maps< – Visualize connections between Physics concepts in real time.
<br>
Remedial Modules – Printable and digital materials for learners with academic backlogs.
<br>
FunWeb App (Beta) – An upcoming mobile application for learning anytime, anywhere.
<br>
Assessments and Reflections – Quizzes, journals, and feedback forms that help track learning progress.
<br>
Teacher Integration Tools– Designed to assist educators in implementing remedial Physics lessons effectively. </p>

<h2>💡 Our Vision</h2>

<p>To create an engaging, accessible, and conceptually strong Physics learning experience for every student, ensuring that no learner is left behind, in alignment with the Department of Education’s (DepEd) mission to promote Access, Equity, and Quality in education.</p>

<h2>🕸️ Why “FunWeb”?</h2>

<p> The name FunWeb reflects both its structure and philosophy:
<br>
“Web” symbolizes the interconnectedness of Physics ideas.
<br>
“Fun” emphasizes that learning Physics can be enjoyable, engaging, and rewarding when concepts are seen as part of a bigger picture.
<br>
Just like a spider web, every concept in Physics supports another  remove one strand, and the entire web weakens. FunWeb helps rebuild and strengthen those strands, ensuring students can grasp Physics as a complete, connected system.

<h2>✨ FunWeb: Learning Physics the Connected Way</h2>

“Where every force, motion, and energy is part of one web, your web of understanding.”
