  <h1>Motion</h1>
  <i>“Motion is the heart of Physics — it is the language that describes how and why things move.”</i>
  <p>
    Motion refers to the change in position of an object with respect to a reference point over time.
    It occurs when an object changes its location, direction, or speed.
    In Physics, motion is not only about “movement” but also about understanding how, why, and under what forces that movement occurs.
  </p>

  <h2>Mathematical Relationships</h2>
  <p><strong>Speed:</strong> <code>Speed = Distance / Time</code></p>
  <p><strong>Velocity:</strong> <code>Velocity = Displacement / Time</code></p>
  <p><strong>Acceleration:</strong> <code>Acceleration = Change in Velocity / Time</code></p>
  <p><strong>Newton’s Second Law:</strong> <code>F = m × a</code></p>

  <h2>Real-Life Applications of Motion</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Transportation Systems – Design vehicles, manage traffic, improve fuel efficiency.</li>
    <li>Sports Physics – Players apply principles when throwing, kicking, or hitting objects.</li>
    <li>Space Exploration – Rocket launches, orbits, and reentry depend on motion calculations.</li>
    <li>Amusement Rides – Roller coasters rely on motion and energy transfer.</li>
    <li>Everyday Observation – Walking, dropping objects, and driving cars illustrate motion.</li>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Heavier objects fall faster than lighter ones.</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>If velocity is zero, acceleration must also be zero.</td>
        <td>Not always true — Acceleration can exist even at rest if velocity is about to change.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Circular motion at constant speed means no acceleration.</td>
        <td>False — The object accelerates because its direction continuously changes.</td>
