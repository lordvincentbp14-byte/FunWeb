  <h1>Force</h1>
  <i>“Force is the invisible link that changes motion, starts motion, or stops motion — the heartbeat of every interaction in Physics.”</i>

  <h2>Definition</h2>
  <p>Force is defined as a push or pull exerted on an object that causes it to move, stop, or change its shape or direction. It has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity.</p>
  <p>In simple terms, force is the cause of motion. It explains why objects move, accelerate, slow down, or remain at rest. Without force, there is no change in motion — only stillness.</p>

  
  <p>Through collaboration and guided questioning, learners progress from everyday observation to scientific understanding, building a personal “mental web” of how forces influence everything they see and do. Students are not told what force is — they discover it through experience, visualization, and reflection.</p>

  <h2>Mathematical Relationship</h2>
  <p><strong>Newton’s Second Law:</strong> <code>F = m × a</code></p>
  <p>Where:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>F</strong> = Force (Newtons, N)</li>
    <li><strong>m</strong> = Mass (kg)</li>
    <li><strong>a</strong> = Acceleration (m/s²)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Real-Life Applications of Force</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Transportation – Engines and brakes apply forces to move or stop vehicles.</li>
    <li>Sports – Kicking a ball, hitting a shuttlecock, or throwing a javelin.</li>
    <li>Construction – Cranes use tension and applied forces to lift heavy materials.</li>
    <li>Everyday Life – Opening doors, walking, or squeezing toothpaste involves force.</li>
    <li>Space Science – Rocket thrust demonstrates Newton’s Third Law: every action has an equal and opposite reaction.</li>
  </ul>

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Objects move only when a force is continuously applied.</td>
        <td>Wrong — motion continues even without ongoing force, as long as no friction or external resistance acts (Newton’s First Law).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Heavier objects fall faster because they have more force.</td>
        <td>Incorrect — in a vacuum, all objects fall at the same acceleration due to gravity.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>If no motion occurs, there is no force.</td>
        <td>False — balanced forces can act in opposite directions, resulting in no motion.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Force is energy.</td>
        <td>Misunderstanding — force causes changes in motion, while energy is the capacity to do work.</td>
